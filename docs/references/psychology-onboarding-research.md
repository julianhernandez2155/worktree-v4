# Psychology-Driven Student Onboarding Research

This document contains the comprehensive research on psychology-driven onboarding strategies for student platforms, based on extensive analysis of behavioral psychology, self-determination theory, and user experience design principles.

## Key Research Files

1. **Hook & Nudge Model** - The primary research document advocating for low-friction initial onboarding followed by contextual data collection
2. **Comprehensive Psychology Blueprint** - Detailed analysis of psychometric frameworks, behavioral economics, and implementation strategies

## Core Principles Applied in Worktree

### 1. The Hook & Nudge Model
- **Hook**: Get users into the platform in under 60 seconds with minimal data
- **Nudge**: Collect additional data at contextually relevant moments
- **Result**: Higher completion rates and better data quality

### 2. Self-Determination Theory (SDT)
Three basic psychological needs that drive motivation:
- **Autonomy**: Users choose when and what to share
- **Competence**: Each step provides immediate value and success
- **Relatedness**: Connect users to their community

### 3. Behavioral Economics
- **Commitment devices**: Small initial commitments increase follow-through
- **Loss aversion**: Frame inaction as missing out on opportunities
- **Social proof**: Show what peers are doing at decision points
- **Default effects**: Set helpful defaults that benefit users

### 4. Psychometric Frameworks Used
- **Big Five Personality Traits**: For work style matching
- **RIASEC (Holland Codes)**: For interest-based recommendations
- **Grit Scale**: For measuring perseverance
- **Growth Mindset**: For understanding learning approach

### 5. Data Quality Principles
- **Progressive disclosure**: Don't overwhelm with too many questions
- **Contextual relevance**: Ask for data when it's immediately useful
- **Value exchange**: Always provide value in return for data
- **Validation through behavior**: Verify self-reported data through actions

## Implementation in Worktree

### Quick Start (30-60 seconds)
- Students: Name, university, primary role
- Org Leaders: Organization setup, primary challenge
- Admins: Goals and metrics selection

### Contextual Prompts
- When viewing org workspace: "Your org needs these skills..."
- After completing task: "Add this to your verified skills?"
- After adding skills: "Discover your work style..."

### Progressive Profiling Triggers
1. **Skill Collection**: When relevant to current context
2. **Work Style Assessment**: After 3+ skills added
3. **Grit Assessment**: After 2 projects completed
4. **Peer Matching**: When browsing opportunities

## Ethical Considerations

### FERPA Compliance
- All assessment data = education records
- Granular consent required
- Transparent data usage

### Trust Building
- Explain why each piece of data is needed
- Show immediate value from data provided
- Allow users to skip or update later
- Never feel extractive, always beneficial

## Success Metrics

### Engagement
- Quick start completion: >85%
- First skill added: <48 hours
- Profile completeness: 50% by week 1
- Assessment completion: 30% by month 1

### Quality
- Data consistency across time
- Behavioral validation of self-reported skills
- Match quality improvements with more data
